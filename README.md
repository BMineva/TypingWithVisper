# Welcome to Typing with Visper!

This is the code from my alevel coding project. 

i chose to develop a platormer style game to help teach children to recognise the keys on a keyborad, after seeing the need in my little brother whenever he wanted to use my laptop

If I had more time, or if I did not struggle with the log spawning as much, I would have worked on the milestone 9 and rating a tutorial for milestones 6-8 as well as adding a score feature. My additional goals were too ambitious, and I realised that I needed to not include some in my success criteria.
